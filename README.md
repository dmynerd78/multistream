# Multistream Viewer

![Multistream dashboard](imgs/preview.png)

Inspired by [@benbaptist](https://github.com/benbaptist)'s multistream website. He got busy so I figured I'd try and make my own version.

## [Live version here](https://dmynerd78.me/multi/)

### Features

- View multiple streams on a single window
- Show chats only
- Show videos only
- Show channel viewer count (Twitch also supports uptime)
- Dynamically add and remove streams
- Resize chat-to-video ratio to your preference
